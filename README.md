# traj

The goal of traj is to implements the three-step procedure proposed by
Leffondree et al.Â (2004) to identify clusters of individual longitudinal
trajectories. The procedure involves (1) calculating a number of
measures of change capturing various features of the trajectories; (2)
using a PCA-based dimensionality reduction algorithm to select a subset
of measures and (3) using the K-means clustering algorithm to identify
clusters of trajectories.
